[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)]() [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@appwise/eslint-config-vue.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@appwise/eslint-config-vue) [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html#your-first-pull-request)


Every project uses the same eslint config, so we can easily maintain the same code style.
This also ensures that all our projects are consistent and that we don't lose time on code style.
